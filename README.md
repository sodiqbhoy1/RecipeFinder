# Recipe Finder

Recipe Finder is a React-based web app that allows users to search for recipes using the Spoonacular API. Users can enter a search term, view a list of recipes, and click a button to view detailed recipe information.

## Features

- **Search for recipes**: Enter a search term and find recipes related to it.
- **Display recipes**: For each recipe, you can see the title, image, description, and a link to view the full recipe.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages when no recipes are found or if there's an issue fetching data.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components in a responsive and modern way.
